## Setup

You need to have a Steadybit account and an API token. You can create an API token in the Steadybit platform under
"Settings" â†’ "API Access Tokens". Both token types, `Admin` or `Team` are supported.

### Supported ENV-Variables

- `API_TOKEN`: The API token to use for authentication. This is required.
- `API_URL`: The URL of the Steadybit API. Default is `https://platform.steadybit.com/api`.

### Usage with [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)

- Settings -> Developer -> Edit
- Add the following JSON to the file, make sure to replace `<your-api-token>` with your actual API token.:
  ```
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "steadybit": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-e",
          "API_TOKEN",
          "ghcr.io/steadybit/mcp:latest",
        ],
        "env": {
          "API_TOKEN": "<your-api-token>",
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## Development

Please note that there will be no logging to the console when running the MCP Server. The server uses STDIO transport
to communicate with the MCP Clients. Have a look at the `steadybit-mcp.log` file to see the output of the server.

### Local Testing

- Build the project:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

- Test with the MCP inspector:
    - Launch the inspector:
      ```bash
      npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector java -jar target/mcp-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jara -e API_URL=https://platform.steadybit.com/api -e API_TOKEN=123456
      ```
    - Logs can be found in `steadybit-mcp.log` located in the folder where you started the inspector.

- Use in [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
    - Settings -> Developer -> Edit
    - Add something like below.
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "steadybit": {
          "command": "/Users/danielreuter/.sdkman/candidates/java/current/bin/java",
          "args": [
            "-jar",
            "/Users/danielreuter/.m2/repository/com/steadybit/mcp/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/mcp-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"
          ],
          "env": {
            "API_URL": "https://platform.steadybit.com/api",
            "API_TOKEN": "123456",  
            "LOGGING_FILE_NAME": "/Users/danielreuter/Library/Logs/Claude/steadybit-mcp-server.log"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    - MCP-Client-Logs can be found in `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-steadybit.log`
    - MCP-Server-Logs can be found in `~/Library/Logs/Claude/steadybit-mcp.log`, depending on the `LOGGING_FILE_NAME`
      you set in the `env` section.

### Building and testing the Docker image

- Build the image:
  ```bash
  docker build -t steadybit/mcp -f Dockerfile . 
  ```

- Create a file `config.json` with the following content:
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "steadybit": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-e",
          "API_TOKEN",
          "-e",
          "API_URL",
          "steadybit/mcp"
        ],
        "env": {
          "API_TOKEN": "123456",
          "API_URL":"https://platform.steadybit.com/api"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- Run the inspector:
  ```bash
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --config config.json --server steadybit
  ```

### Building a native image

- Install GraalVM 24.0.1 with the following command using sdkman:
    ```bash
    sdk install java 24.0.1-graalce
    ```

- Use the GraalVM version:
    ```bash
    sdk use java 24.0.1-graalce
    ```

- Build the native image:
    ```bash
    mvn -Pnative native:compile
    ```
